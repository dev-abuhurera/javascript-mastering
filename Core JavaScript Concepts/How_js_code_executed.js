// How js works and Code Executes
/*
// --------------------------------------------------
 ---> Is javascript synchronous or asynchronous
 ---> Is javascript Single threaded or multi threaded
// --------------------------------------------------


Fundamental:-

-->>> 

-> Everything happens inside the javascript in the ((execution Context))


----->>>>>                                                          [[[[[[[[[Execution Context]]]]]]]]


- Compromise of the 2 components in it 


--->>                                  Memory (variable environment)              ||               Code (Thread of Execution)

                            All the variable and functions are existed here in the             Code part is where whole code is executed as a thread in the 
                                                                                                line by line form.
                            for of key value pairs

                            - a = 10; --->>> (a : 10)

----------->>>>                     Javasctipt is the synchronous single threaded language

1. Synchronous  2. Single threaded Language


--->>>>                         So, | synchronous || single threaded | ---->>>>> Javascipt code is executed only one line at a time and in a particular order where one line is executed after the second one completes.
