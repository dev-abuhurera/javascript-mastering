        So, now how it will behave ====> now this variable i has the function y so what is the lexical scope behaviour and all

        How this (i) will now behave outside the scope ===> like outside the function scope ===> 
            
        
            // For example 

            now the function is residing in the i and we have a long and long program and at some point of time we called the function i

        ====> Functions are that much beautifull that even when they are returned ---->> from other function then they remember there lexical scope

 This is where we need to understand that the variable inside the function ====> is actually the referance to the memory location
