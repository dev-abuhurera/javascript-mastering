                        Now let me show you the whole concepts here ----->>>>

                                                            What is the scope ?????

                                            Scope is some where we access a specific variable and function  ----------------------((((1))))                                                


                            ----->> 'SCOPE IS DIRECTLY DEPENDANT ON THE LEXICAL ENVIRONMENT'

    
        1. Lexical means in heriarchyyy --------(1)


       ---->> Lexical ------>>> in heriarchy with parents 

       like when an execution context is created it has a referance to its parent memory --->> So it is the lexical to its parent memory


    
    for eg:-


    function w(){

            q = 100;


            r();
            
            function r(){
                
            }

    ----->>> Now the function 'r' --->> It is inside the function 'w' ----->>> So it can be said that the (((r))) is lexical to (((w))) right.......

    It means it exist in the memory space of this function 

    So, when if i try t0 --->> Log out the value of variable in the function --->>> js engine check the memory space of the LEC of the funciton ---->> If it don't get this in it ----->> the execution context will be moving to the lexical parent where the fuction existed

    Then the global Execution Context ---->> And then if the variable is not there --->>> It will be moving to the Null

    (THen it will say that the variable is not defined )



So, this is the                                                                 [[[[[[[[SCOPE CHAINING]]]]]]

                                                                             The chain of the lexical environment 


                                                                 ''' Lexical Environment is the local memory + lexical Parent '''


}

    console.log(q); 

    w();
