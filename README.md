## 📘 About This Repository

This repository documents my **personal journey** toward truly **mastering JavaScript** — not just syntax, but the *core mechanics* that make it run.  
It’s an evolving collection of my **notes, visual breakdowns, and conceptual maps** as I learn what’s really happening *under the hood*.

> 💡 “I’m continuously updating this repo as I uncover new layers of JavaScript.”

## 🧭 Learning Flow Overview

Here’s how the concepts are connected — from the fundamentals to the advanced layers of JavaScript:

🧱 Core Concepts Breakdown

Here’s what I’ve covered so far 👇

Concept	Description
🧱 Hoisting	How declarations are processed before execution, allowing access to variables and functions before they appear.
⚡ Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)	The “no-access” zone before a let or const variable is initialized.
🌍 Global Execution Context	The starting point — where all JavaScript code begins execution.
🧭 Lexical Environment	Determines variable accessibility based on where code is written.
🧩 Closures	When functions retain access to variables from their outer scope, even after that scope ends.
🧵 Call Stack	The stack structure that controls function execution order.
💾 Memory Allocation	Happens before execution — variables and functions are set up here.
🔗 Scope Chain	How JavaScript searches for variables through nested scopes.
🧍‍♂️ this Keyword	Dynamic context — depends on how a function is called.
🕶️ Shadowing	When an inner variable hides an outer variable of the same name.
🚫 Error Types	TypeError, ReferenceError, SyntaxError — what they mean and when they appear.

  participant Memory as 🧠 Memory
  participant Code as 💻 Code Execution
  participant Stack as 📚 Call Stack
  participant WebAPI as 🌐 Web APIs
  participant Queue as 🕒 Callback Queue

  Code->>Memory: Allocate variables & functions (Creation Phase)
  Code->>Stack: Push function calls
  Stack-->>Code: Execute synchronously
  Code->>WebAPI: Send async tasks (e.g., setTimeout)
  WebAPI-->>Queue: Push callback after delay
  Queue->>Stack: Callback executed after stack clears


This diagram visualizes how JavaScript handles synchronous and asynchronous code step-by-step.

🧾 Notes & Insights

All my personal notes are written in a simplified, visual-first format —
no textbook jargon, just intuitive explanations.

🧠 Goal: To understand why JavaScript behaves the way it does.

💬 Topics include:

Variable lifecycle & scope resolution

How JavaScript “remembers” variables (closures)

The anatomy of asynchronous code

🚀 Upcoming Topics
🔜 Topic	Focus
🔁 Event Loop	Understanding concurrency & task scheduling
⏳ Promises / Async-Await	Managing asynchronous operations
🧬 Prototypes & Inheritance	Object behavior and reusability
📦 Modules	Organizing and importing/exporting code
🧩 Design Patterns	Clean and scalable JavaScript structure
🎯 Learning Progress

✅ Hoisting
✅ Scope & Lexical Environment
✅ Closures
🕒 Event Loop (in progress)
🔜 Promises & Async/Await
