## 📚 About This Repository

This repository documents my **personal journey** toward mastering **JavaScript** — not just from a syntax perspective, but by diving deep into its **internal mechanisms**.

> I’m continuously updating this repo as I learn something new about JavaScript.

---

## 🧠 Repository Structure

### 🧩 1. Core JavaScript Concepts
This section focuses on the **“how it works”** part of JavaScript — understanding what happens *behind the scenes* inside the **JavaScript engine**.

You'll find detailed summaries on topics like:
- Execution contexts
- Memory allocation
- Engine internals
- Event loop, and more.

> Think of this section as the *“JavaScript brain dissection lab.”*

---

### 📒 2. Notes & Insights
In this part, I’ve collected all my **personal notes**, simplified explanations, and conceptual breakdowns — written in my own words to ensure true understanding.

Every note aims to make the **why** behind the behavior of JavaScript crystal clear.

## 🔍 Topics Covered So Far

Here’s what I’ve learned and documented till now 👇

## 🧠 Core JavaScript Concepts

## 🧠 Core JavaScript Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| 🧱 **Hoisting** | How declarations are processed before execution, allowing access to variables and functions before they appear in code. |
| ⚡ **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)** | The period between entering a scope and the actual declaration of a `let` or `const` variable — accessing it here throws a `ReferenceError`. |
| 🧩 **`let` and `const` Hoisting** | These are hoisted but **not initialized** until their declaration line is reached, unlike `var`. |
| 🌍 **Global Execution Context** | The default environment where all JavaScript code begins execution. |
| 🧭 **Lexical Environment** | Defines where variables and functions are accessible based on where they are **physically written** in the code. |
| 🧩 **Lexical Block Scoping** | A combination of lexical scoping and block-level scope; variables defined with `let` or `const` inside a block are accessible only within that block and determined by where they are written in the code. |
| 🔄 **Closures** | When a function “remembers” variables from its outer scope even after that scope has finished execution. |
| 🧵 **Call Stack** | A stack-like structure that keeps track of which function is currently running and which one to return to next. |
| 💾 **Memory Allocation** | Happens during the **creation phase** — variables and functions are set up before code runs. |
| 🔗 **Scope Chaining** | The process of searching variables upward through nested scopes until the global scope. |
| 🧍‍♂️ **`this` Keyword** | Refers to the object that is currently executing the function; its value depends on how the function is called. |
| 🧱 **Block Scoping** | Variables declared with `let` and `const` are limited to the block `{}` in which they are defined. |
| 🕶️ **Shadowing** | When a variable in a local scope has the same name as one in an outer scope, temporarily hiding (or “shadowing”) it. |
| 🚫 **TypeError, SyntaxError, and ReferenceError** | Common JavaScript errors — `TypeError` for invalid operations on data types, `SyntaxError` for invalid code structure, and `ReferenceError` for using undeclared variables. |

## 🧭 The Journey Continues...

This repository is not about memorizing methods or properties —  
it’s about building a **deep understanding** of *how JavaScript thinks.*

Next topics I’ll dive into:

- 🔁 **Event Loop**
- ⏳ **Promises & Async/Await**
- 🧬 **Prototypes & Inheritance**
- 📦 **Modules**
- 🧩 **Advanced Patterns**

> I believe true mastery begins when you stop just *writing code* — and start understanding *why* it behaves that way.
