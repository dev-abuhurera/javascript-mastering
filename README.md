# 🧠 JavaScript Mastering



This repository is my personal journey toward mastering **JavaScript** — not just by learning its syntax, but by deeply understanding **how things actually work under the hood**.  

I’ll be updating this repo continuously as I explore and learn new concepts related to JavaScript.

## 🚀 About This Repository

The repository is divided into two main parts:

### 1. **Core JavaScript Concepts**
Here, I’ve summarized all the **fundamental and advanced concepts** that explain the *internal workings* of JavaScript — how the **JavaScript engine** operates, how **execution contexts** are created, and how everything fits together to make JavaScript the powerful language it is.  

This section isn’t just notes — it’s my collection of insights, mental models, and simplified breakdowns of what’s actually happening behind the scenes.

### 2. **Notes & Understanding**
This is where I’ve documented every single concept I’ve gone through so far, including the “why” behind each topic.  
Each note is written in a way that helps me (and others) truly **understand the logic behind the behavior** of JavaScript.

## 🧩 Topics Covered So Far

I’ve already gone through a solid part of the JavaScript foundation, including:

- 🧱 **Hoisting** — how declarations are moved before code execution.  
- 🌍 **Global Execution Context** — where everything begins.  
- 🧭 **Lexical Environment** — how scope is determined at creation.  
- 🧰 **Closures** — how functions remember their outer variables.  
- 🧵 **Call Stack** — how JavaScript executes code line by line.  
- 💾 **Memory Allocation & Execution Phases** — what happens under the hood before and during runtime.  
- 🔗 **Scope Chaining** — how JavaScript looks for variables.  
- 🧍‍♂️ **`this` Keyword** — understanding how its value changes in different contexts.  

…and a lot more coming soon as I continue this journey!

## 🌱 The Journey Continues...

This repository is an ongoing documentation of my **JavaScript mastery journey** — from understanding how the **engine works internally** to writing cleaner, optimized, and more predictable code.  

I believe that true mastery comes when we stop just writing code — and start understanding **why** it works the way it does.

Stay tuned for more updates as I dive deeper into concepts like:
- Event Loop  
- Promises & Async/Await  
- Prototype & Inheritance  
- Modules  
- Advanced Patterns
