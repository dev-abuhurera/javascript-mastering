## 📚 About This Repository

This repository documents my **personal journey** toward mastering **JavaScript** — not just from a syntax perspective, but by diving deep into its **internal mechanisms**.

> I’m continuously updating this repo as I learn something new about JavaScript.

---

## 🧠 Repository Structure

### 🧩 1. Core JavaScript Concepts
This section focuses on the **“how it works”** part of JavaScript — understanding what happens *behind the scenes* inside the **JavaScript engine**.

You'll find detailed summaries on topics like:
- Execution contexts
- Memory allocation
- Engine internals
- Event loop, and more.

> Think of this section as the *“JavaScript brain dissection lab.”*

---

### 📒 2. Notes & Insights
In this part, I’ve collected all my **personal notes**, simplified explanations, and conceptual breakdowns — written in my own words to ensure true understanding.

Every note aims to make the **why** behind the behavior of JavaScript crystal clear.

## 🔍 Topics Covered So Far

Here’s what I’ve learned and documented till now 👇

| Concept | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| 🧱 **Hoisting** | How declarations are processed before execution. |
| 🌍 **Global Execution Context** | The starting point of all JavaScript programs. |
| 🧭 **Lexical Environment** | How scope is defined when code is written. |
| 🔄 **Closures** | How functions remember variables even after their parent scope is gone. |
| 🧵 **Call Stack** | The structure managing execution order in JavaScript. |
| 💾 **Memory Allocation** | What happens before execution actually starts. |
| 🔗 **Scope Chaining** | How JavaScript finds variables up the chain. |
| 🧍‍♂️ **`this` Keyword** | Understanding how its value changes depending on context. |

## 🧭 The Journey Continues...

This repository is not about memorizing methods or properties —  
it’s about building a **deep understanding** of *how JavaScript thinks.*

Next topics I’ll dive into:

- 🔁 **Event Loop**
- ⏳ **Promises & Async/Await**
- 🧬 **Prototypes & Inheritance**
- 📦 **Modules**
- 🧩 **Advanced Patterns**

> I believe true mastery begins when you stop just *writing code* — and start understanding *why* it behaves that way.
